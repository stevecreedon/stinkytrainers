<h1>3. Create the Dashboard Page</h1>

<p>The home page is for anyone on the world wide web that happens to be passing by www.strinkytrainers.com but we&#39;re building a web application and we want it have logged-in users so that they can manage their games &amp; their friends. We want our logged-in users to have their own personalised home page, let&#39;s call it a <strong>dashboard</strong>.</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="#controller-for-the-dashboard">Controller for the Dashboard</a></li>
<li><a href="#make-the-dashboard-controller-restful">Make the Dashboard controller RESTful.</a></li>
<li><a href="#the-dashboard-view">The Dashboard view</a></li>
<li><a href="#test-the-dashboard-view">Test the Dashboard View </a></li>
</ol>

<p>In this section we&#39;ll create a controller and a view for this dashboard (though there won&#39;t be much to show in it for a while). Then in the next section we&#39;ll create a User model and secure the dashboard with the Devise gem that will give us lots of log-in and forgotten password functionality almost out of the box.</p>

<h2><a id='controller-for-the-dashboard'></a> 3.1. Controller for the Dashboard</h2>

<p>We want our users to have a dashboard page where they can easily see their friends, players and matches. Because Rails is an MVC framework the first thing we must do is create a controller. When our users make a request, Rails will then match the request to an action in our controller that will then run the appropriate view. Run the command</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="go">bundle exec rails g controller dashboard index</span>
</pre></div>

<p>and we should see:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="go">create  app/controllers/dashboard_controller.rb</span>
<span class="go">       route  get &quot;dashboard/index&quot;</span>
<span class="go">      invoke  erb</span>
<span class="go">      create    app/views/dashboard</span>
<span class="go">      create    app/views/dashboard/index.html.erb</span>
<span class="go">      invoke  rspec</span>
<span class="go">      create    spec/controllers/dashboard_controller_spec.rb</span>
<span class="go">      create    spec/views/dashboard</span>
<span class="go">      create    spec/views/dashboard/index.html.erb_spec.rb</span>
<span class="go">      invoke  helper</span>
<span class="go">      create    app/helpers/dashboard_helper.rb</span>
<span class="go">      invoke    rspec</span>
<span class="go">      create      spec/helpers/dashboard_helper_spec.rb</span>
<span class="go">      invoke  assets</span>
<span class="go">      invoke    coffee</span>
<span class="go">      create      app/assets/javascripts/dashboard.js.coffee</span>
<span class="go">      invoke    scss</span>
<span class="go">      create      app/assets/stylesheets/dashboard.css.scss</span>
</pre></div>

<p><strong>What just happened ?</strong> </p>

<p>Rails has generated a controller called dashboard and gave it an index action.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">DashboardController</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ApplicationController</span>  
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">index</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</pre></div>

<p>It also created a view called app/views/index.html.erb. Remembering our Restful routing in section 2, 1.3 - when a browser calls www.stinkytrainers.com/dashboard, Rails will route this request to the index action of the dashboard controller, which in turn renders the view app/views/dashboard/index.html.erb:</p>

<div class="fb-comments"
     data-href="http://www.stinkytrainers.co.uk/ruby-on-rails-tutorial/3-create-the-dashboard-view.html#controller-for-the-dashboard"
     data-num-posts="2"
     data-width="auto">
</div>

<p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>

<h2><a id='make-the-dashboard-controller-restful'></a> 3.2. Make the Dashboard controller RESTful.</h2>

<p><strong>GET /dashboard  &gt; app/controllers/dashboard_controller.rb#index &gt; app/views/dashboard/index.html.erb</strong></p>

<p>Rails also created some helpers and spec files for us which we&#39;ll come to in a bit. In it&#39;s effort to be helpful Rails also created something for us that we <strong>DON&#39;T WANT</strong>. If you look in <strong>config/routes.rb</strong> you&#39;ll see the line:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">get</span> <span class="s2">&quot;dashboard/index&quot;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Up until now you&#39;ve had to trust me when I say things like &#39;Rails will route this request to the index action&#39; but I didn&#39;t say how. It all happens in <strong>config/routes.rb</strong>. Rails provides us with a number of options for matching requests to controllers and actions. <strong>get &quot;dashboard/index&quot;</strong> is a very literal mapping of the GET /dashboard request. We could use it but as our application grows we&#39;ll have many such routes and so we&#39;d end up with very many of these lines. This approach to <strong>config/routes.rb</strong> will become hard to handle.</p>

<p>Remember again in Section 2 where we had Restful controllers that all had similar actions ? Going back to 1.3 in that section again, I didn&#39;t explain how Rails would match request to our nicely standardised Restful controller/actions in a standard way. We&#39;ll do that by using similar Rest concepts in our config/routes.rb. </p>

<p>First delete the line from config/routes.rb</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">get</span> <span class="s2">&quot;dashboard/index&quot;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>In it&#39;s place put: </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">resources</span> <span class="ss">:dashboard</span> 
</pre></div>

<p>This tells Rails that we want dashboard to be a Restful resource. This one line - <strong>resources :dashboard</strong> -  does the job of seven routes:</p>

<table style="margin: 20px; font-weight: bold;" cellpadding="5px">
    <tr><td>GET</td><td>/dashboard</td><td>dashboard_controller#index</td></tr>
    <tr><td>GET</td><td>/dashboard/new</td><td>dashboard_controller#new</td></tr>
    <tr><td>POST</td><td>/dashboard</td><td>dashbaord_controller#create</td></tr>
    <tr><td>GET</td><td>/dashboard/123</td><td>dashbaord_controller#show</td></tr>
    <tr><td>GET</td><td>/dashboard/123/edit</td><td>dashbaord_controller#edit</td></tr>
    <tr><td>PUT</td><td>/dashboard/123</td><td>dashbaord_controller#update</td></tr>
    <tr><td>DELETE</td><td>/dashboard/123</td><td>dashbaord_controller#destroy</td></tr>
</table>

<p>You can see these routes in the console by running:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="go">rake routes</span>
</pre></div>

<p>which should return a list of requests and their matching controller#actions</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="go">dashboard_index GET    /dashboard(.:format)              dashboard#index</span>
<span class="go">                POST   /dashboard(.:format)              dashboard#create</span>
<span class="go">  new_dashboard GET    /dashboard/new(.:format)          dashboard#new</span>
<span class="go"> edit_dashboard GET    /dashboard/:id/edit(.:format)     dashboard#edit</span>
<span class="go">      dashboard GET    /dashboard/:id(.:format)          dashboard#show</span>
<span class="go">                PUT    /dashboard/:id(.:format)          dashboard#update</span>
<span class="go">                DELETE /dashboard/:id(.:format)          dashboard#destroy</span>
<span class="go">           root        /                                 home#index                        home#index</span>
</pre></div>

<p>We&#39;ll be using that same mechanism for all of the remaining controllers in this application. Of course, not every controller will need ALL of the above actions. We may not want to be able to edit something or destroy something and our dashboard_controller is a prime example of that. We only want the index action so amend the line:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">resources</span> <span class="ss">:dashboard</span>
</pre></div>

<p>so that it becomes</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">resources</span> <span class="ss">:dashboard</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:only</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:index</span><span class="o">]</span> 
</pre></div>

<p>Now run rake routes again:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="go">rake routes</span>
</pre></div>

<p>and the output this time should be a much reduced:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="go">dashboard_index GET /dashboard(.:format)              dashboard#index</span>
<span class="go">           root     /                                 home#index</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Rails Resources give us a simple and standard way to handle our routes and controllers.</p>

<h2><a id='the-dashboard-view'></a> 3.3. The Dashboard view</h2>

<p>add this html to app/views/dashboard/index.html.erb</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">h1</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="no">Stinky</span> <span class="no">Trainers</span> <span class="no">Dashboard</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/h1&gt;</span>
</pre></div>

<h3>3.3.1. Add a link from the home page to the dashboard</h3>

<p>We want to be able to get from the home page to the dashboard so let&#39;s just add a navigation link. We could hard code a URL or relative path such as <a href="/dashboard">dashboard</a> into our navigation but instead we&#39;re going to turn to rails routing again and use something called named paths.</p>

<p>In the file app/views/layouts/application.html.erb change the line:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">li</span><span class="o">&gt;&lt;%=</span> <span class="n">link_to</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Link1&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;/path1&quot;</span>  <span class="sx">%&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>to</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">li</span><span class="o">&gt;&lt;%=</span> <span class="n">link_to</span> <span class="s2">&quot;dashboard&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">dashboard_index_path</span>  <span class="sx">%&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>now start your application (if it isn&#39;t already running)</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="go">rails s</span>
</pre></div>

<p>and browse to localhost:3000 which should open our home page. At the top of the page you&#39;ll see our dashboard navigation link we created above. Click on it to see our dashboard page.</p>

<p><strong>What just happened ?</strong> </p>

<p>Rails uses metaprogramming to create named paths. If you run <strong>rake routes</strong> again</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="go">rake routes</span>
</pre></div>

<p>you see the line</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="go">dashboard_index GET /dashboard(.:format)              dashboard#index</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The first part, <strong>dashboard_index</strong> is a Rails named path which uses Ruby meta-programming. We have the options to create two kinds of named path:</p>

<ul>
<li>dashboard<em>index</em>path = &quot;/dashboard&quot;</li>
<li>dashboard<em>index</em>url = &quot;www.stinkytrainers.com/dashboard&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s common practice to use the &#39;<em>path&#39; option rather than the &#39;</em>url&#39; option so dashboard<em>index</em>path gives us our URL. </p>

<p>Why go to the bother of using named paths ? What&#39;s the problem with hard-coding the string &#39;/dashboard&#39; ? Well, a bit like our controllers, we&#39;ve only just begun and we&#39;ll be moving-on to much more complicated URLs and to nested resources. Don&#39;t worry if you&#39;re not sure what &#39;nested resource&#39; means we&#39;ll be covering it in detail later but, in brief, a nested resource will have a URL something like /users/123/games/17/comments/2 meaning that our user 123 has a game with id 17 &amp; that game has a comment with id 2. We can get this as a named path with code like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">users_games_comments_path</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">user</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">game</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">comment</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Rather than building the string &quot;/users/123/games/17/comments/2&quot; in code. OK, we could write some kind of helper method that builds the many urls we would need in this app but that&#39;s just what a <strong>named path</strong> is, it&#39;s a helper method given to us by Rails for free &amp; we get it for free because we&#39;ve stuck to the Rails conventions.</p>
