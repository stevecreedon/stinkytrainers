# The Game Model

![Stinky Trainers Game Model Diagram](/assets/stinky trainers game model.png)

As you can see from the diagram Game has a `has_and_belongs_to_many` relationship with User and we've added another class, External Player. We want our users to be able to invite anyone to a game not just other StinkTrainers users. We could just add a list of email address to a game that represent the external players but then our application would have to cope with a player that's either a User object or a string and that may make our code a little hard to handle. So we're going to add the model External Player, effectively a user that hasn't signed-up. Our game can then have a collection called players and a collection of external_players. If an external player chooses to sign-up with Stinky Trainers then they'll see all of the gaems they're connected to.

We're going to get much more TDD and write tests for the Game model and the ExternalPLayer model first then make them pass.

INDEX

## Tests for the Game Model

### First Draft
First I'll write down some empty pending test before I start thinking about code.

~~~ruby
it 'should not be valid if the game has no location'

it 'should not be valid if the game has no date'

it 'should not be valid if the game has no sport'

it 'should return a list of external players ordered by email'

it 'should return a list of players ordered by email'

it 'should return true if the game is in the past'

it 'should return false if the game is not in the past'

it 'should not be valid if the game has no owner'
~~~

### Now Code the tests
Create the file spec/models/game_spec.rb and code the tests.

~~~ruby
require 'spec_helper'

describe Game do

	it 'should not be valid if the game has no location' do
	  game = Game.new(:location => nil)
	  game.valid?.should be_false
	  game.errors.to_a.should include("Location can't be blank")
	end

	it 'should not be valid if the game has no date' do
	  game = Game.new(:at => nil)
	  game.valid?.should be_false
	  game.errors.to_a.should include("At can't be blank")
	end
	
	it 'should not be valid if the game has no sport' do
	  game = Game.new
	  game.valid?.should be_false
	  game.errors.to_a.should include("Sport can't be blank")
	end
	
	it 'should return a list of players ordered by email' do
	  sport = FactoryGirl.create(:sport)
      game = FactoryGirl.create(:game, :sport => sport)

	  andrew = FactoryGirl.create(:user, :email => 'andrew@textxyz.com')
	  zoe = FactoryGirl.create(:user, :email => 'zoe@textxyz.com')
	  mark = FactoryGirl.create(:user, :email => 'mark@textxyz.com')
	  	  
	  game.players << andrew
	  game.players << zoe
	  game.players << mark
	  
	  game.players.should == [andrew, mark, zoe]
	end

	it 'should return a list of external players ordered by email' do
	  sport = FactoryGirl.create(:sport)
      game = FactoryGirl.create(:game, :sport => sport)

	  andrew = FactoryGirl.create(:external_player, :email => 'andrew@textxyz.com')
	  zoe = FactoryGirl.create(:external_player, :email => 'zoe@textxyz.com')
	  mark = FactoryGirl.create(:external_player, :email => 'mark@textxyz.com')

	  game.external_players << andrew
	  game.external_players << zoe
	  game.external_players << mark

	  game.external_players.should == [andrew, mark, zoe]
	end

	it 'should return true if the game is in the past' do
	  game = Game.new(:at => Time.now - 100)
	  game = game.over?.should be_true
	end

	it 'should return false if the game is not in the past' do
	  game = Game.new(:at => Time.now + 100)
	  game = game.over?.should be_false
	end
	
end
~~~

NOTE: If your wondering why we use Game.new to create a game but FactoryGirl for user and external_player it's because we're testing the game class so it feels wrong to use a mocked FactoryGirl object even though it theoretically is almost the same thing.

COMMENTS

## Tests for the ExternalPlayer model
### First Draft

~~~ruby
it 'should not be valid if the player has no email'

it 'should not be valid if the email already exists'
~~~

### Now Code
### Now write some code

~~~ruby
it 'should not be valid if the player has no email' do
  external_player = ExternalPlayer.new(:email => nil)
  external_player.valid?.should be_false
  external_player.errors.to_a.should include("Email can't be blank")
end

it 'should not be valid if the email already exists' do
  ExternalPlayer.create(:email => 'bolt@lighting.co.uk')

  external_player = ExternalPlayer.new(:email => 'bolt@lighting.co.uk')
  external_player.valid?.should be_false
  external_player.errors.to_a.should include("Email has already been taken")
end
~~~

We've coded our test but we haven't yet created the User or ExternalPlayer model (how TDD is that ?) so if we try running 

~~~console
bundle exec rake spec
~~~

we will get a lot of horrible errors as the Game and ExternalPlayers don't yet exist.

COMMENTS

## Generate the Game and ExternalPlayer models
We'll generate both models so that we can start running tests.

NOTE: We've already written specs for game and external_player so the generator will stop part of the way and warn us of a conflict because the files `spec/models/game_spec.rb` and `spec/models/external_player_spec.rb` already exist.

~~~console
invoke  active_record
   create    db/migrate/20120909094450_create_games.rb
   create    app/models/game.rb
   invoke    rspec
 conflict      spec/models/game_spec.rb
 Overwrite /Users/stephencreedon/devel/stinkytrainers/spec/models/game_spec.rb? (enter "h" for help) [Ynaqdh] n
~~~ 

Just return 'n' (for no) when the generator asks if you want to overwrite the existing file. 

~~~console
bundle exec rails g model game location:string at:datetime
bundle exec rails g model external_player email:string 
~~~

Now we have a Game and ExternalPlayer model try running the tests again

~~~console
bundle exec rake spec
~~~

Rails will object because it's detected that we have migrations for Game and ExternalPlayer that we haven't run yet

~~~console
You have 2 pending migrations:
  20120909094450 CreateGames
  20120909094851 CreateExternalPlayers
Run `rake db:migrate` to update your database then try again.
~~~

Take a quick look at the migrations in db/migrate

~~~ruby
class CreateGames < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :games do |t|
      t.string :location
      t.datetime :at

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
~~~

~~~ruby
class CreateExternalPlayers < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :external_players do |t|
      t.string :email

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
~~~

So run the migrations:

~~~console
bundle exec rake db:migrate
~~~

which should give us

~~~console
==  CreateGames: migrating ====================================================
-- create_table(:games)
   -> 0.0701s
==  CreateGames: migrated (0.0702s) ===========================================

==  CreateExternalPlayers: migrating ==========================================
-- create_table(:external_players)
   -> 0.0014s
==  CreateExternalPlayers: migrated (0.0015s) =================================
~~~

We now have the Game and ExternalPlayer models in our code and the games and external_players tables in the database so we should be able to run the tests.

~~~console
bundle exec rake spec
~~~

The tests will now run but, of course, we should now have 8 failing because we haven't put any code into them yet.

COMMENTS

## Get the Game model #location test passing
The first test requires that we have a location

~~~ruby
it 'should not be valid if the game has no location' do
  game = Game.new(:location => nil)
  game.valid?.should be_false
  game.errors.to_a.should include("Location can't be blank")
end
~~~

Let's use an ActiveModel validation for this:

~~~ruby
class Game < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :at, :location
  
  validates :location, :presence => true
end
~~~

run the tests

~~~console
bundle exec rake spec
~~~

and you should find we only have 7 failing tests.

COMMENTS

## Get the Game model #at test passing
Our second test requires that we have a date

~~~ruby
it 'should not be valid if the game has no date' do
  game = Game.new(:at => nil)
  game.valid?.should be_false
  game.errors.to_a.should include("Date can't be blank")
end
~~~

Again, we'll use an ActiveModel validation for this:

~~~ruby
class Game < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :at, :location
  
  validates :location, :presence => true
  validates :at, :presence => true
end
~~~

Run the tests and we should be down to 7 failures

~~~console
bundle exec rake spec
~~~

COMMENTS

## Get the Game model #sport test passing
Our third test requires that we have a sport

~~~ruby
it 'should not be valid if the game has no sport' do
  game = Game.new
  game.valid?.should be_false
  game.errors.to_a.should include("Sport can't be blank")
end
~~~

The association between Game and Sport is a simple one. A Game belongs\_to Sport and a Sport has\_many games. To create this relationship we need to add a sport_id column to our game and add the association to our Sport and Game classes.

First the migration to add the sport_id column

~~~console
bundle exec rails g migration add_sport_to_game
~~~

This will give us an empty migration in db/migrate. Add the line of code below to add a sport\_id column to the games table. In other words we're adding sport\_id to our game model.

~~~ruby
class AddSportToGame < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    add_column :games, :sport_id, :integer
  end
end
~~~

Now run the migration

~~~
bundle exec rake db:migrate

==  AddSportToGame: migrating =================================================
-- add_column(:games, :sport_id, :integer)
   -> 0.0009s
==  AddSportToGame: migrated (0.0010s) ========================================
~~~

Now let's define the associations:

Sport has many games `has_many :games`:

~~~ruby
class Sport < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :name

  validates :name,   :presence => true, :uniqueness => true
  
  has_and_belongs_to_many :users
  has_many :games
end
~~~

Make Game belong to Sport, `belongs_to :sport` lets also add sport to our list of accessible attributes `attr_accessible :at, :location, :sport`

~~~ruby
class Game < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :at, :location, :sport
  
  validates :location, :presence => true
  validates :at, :presence => true
  
  has_and_belongs_to_many :players, :class_name => 'User', :order => "users.email ASC"
  has_and_belongs_to_many :external_players, :order => "external_players.email ASC"
  belongs_to :sport
  
  def over?
    Time.now > self.at
  end
  
end
~~~

We've defined our association and added the sport_id column to our game model. At this stage we should be able to run the tests without anything dreadful happening. We'll still have a failing test but we shouldn't have anything painful like our game object not knowing what a sport is.

~~~console
bundle exec rake spec

Failures:

  1) Game should not be valid if the game has no sport
     Failure/Error: game.errors.to_a.should include("Sport can't be blank")
       expected ["Location can't be blank", "At can't be blank"] to include "Sport can't be blank"
     # ./spec/models/game_spec.rb:20:in `block (2 levels) in <top (required)>'

~~~

Again, we'll use an ActiveModel validation for this:

~~~ruby
class Game < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :at, :location
  
  validates :location, :presence => true
  validates :at, :presence => true
  validates :sport, :presence => true
end
~~~

The test should now pass.

~~~console
bundle exec rake spec
~~~

One last thing, since we've made sport a required field we should add it to our FactoryGrirl factory so that future tests can create game without having to explicitly specify a sport. Add the line `sport { FactoryGirl.create(:sport) }` to spec/factories/games.rb:

~~~ruby
FactoryGirl.define do
  factory :game do
    location "MyString"
    at "2012-09-09 10:00:00"
    sport { FactoryGirl.create(:sport) }
  end
end
~~~

COMMENTS

## Get the Game model test for ordering players by email passing
For this one we need to add the association between games and players. Now players are actually users but it seems a little odd that a game has a collection of users so we'll create an association called players, tell it to use User and also tell it to order users by email.


This is the test we have to make work

~~~ruby
it 'should return a list of players ordered by email' do
  sport = FactoryGirl.create(:sport)
  game = FactoryGirl.create(:game, :sport => sport)

  andrew = FactoryGirl.create(:user, :email => 'andrew@textxyz.com')
  zoe = FactoryGirl.create(:user, :email => 'zoe@textxyz.com')
  mark = FactoryGirl.create(:user, :email => 'mark@textxyz.com')
  	  
  game.players << andrew
  game.players << zoe
  game.players << mark
  
  game.players.should == [andrew, mark, zoe]
end
~~~

NOTE: we've broken the rule about not using FactoryGirl to create the objects we're testing. In this case it's not so bad because we're actually not testing Game but the association players. We've used FactoryGirl because we needed a valid instance of Game before we can add records to an association. Remember that our games_users join table needs a game_id ? Well if we'd just created Game.new the record isn't saved, if it isn't saved it won't have an id. For the association to work we need a saved, and thus valid instance of game, hence we use FactoryGirl. We could have created a valid game in the test `Game.create(:location => 'xyz', :at => Time.now)` but that would mean every time we add a new validation to Game we'd have to rewrite this line in our tests.

let's create the has\_and\_belongs\_to\_many players association in our game. Note that we have to explicitly tell it that our players collection is actually a user.

~~~ruby
class Game < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :at, :location
  
  validates :location, :presence => true
  validates :at, :presence => true
  has_and_belongs_to_many :players, :class_name_ => 'User'
end
~~~

We also need the has\_and\_belongs\_to\_many relationship that connects our user to games. This time we don't need to do any renaming as user.games makes a little more sense

~~~ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  # Include default devise modules. Others available are:
  # :token_authenticatable, :confirmable,
  # :lockable, :timeoutable and :omniauthable
  devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable,
         :recoverable, :rememberable, :trackable, :validatable

  # Setup accessible (or protected) attributes for your model
  attr_accessible :email, :password, :password_confirmation, :remember_me
  # attr_accessible :title, :body
  
  has_and_belongs_to_many :sports
  has_and_belongs_to_many :games
end
~~~

We've associated game to user and user to game. Since this is a has\_and\_belongs\_to\_many we need to create a join table

~~~console
bundle exec rails g migration CreateGamesUsersJoinTable
~~~

Open the migration in db/migrate. When we created the sports\_users join table we created a more traditional migration that used `def up` and `def down` to handle migrations and rollbacks. This time we'll use the more succinct `def change`

~~~ruby
class CreateGamesUsersJoinTable < ActiveRecord::Migration
  
  def change
    create_table :games_users do |t|
      t.integer :user_id
      t.integer :game_id
    end
    
    add_index :games_users, :user_id
  	add_index :games_users, :game_id
  end
  
end
~~~

NOTE that we've used user\_id not player\_id but because we've specified the class_name as 'User' in our association `:class_name => 'User' our game class will look for a user_id in the join table games_users when we call players.

run the migration

~~~console
bundle exec rake db:migrate
~~~

and we should be ready to see if our test passes.

~~~console
bundle exec rake spec
~~~

We still have 7 tests failing and the one we're interested will be giving us quite a lengthy output

~~~console

~~~

Our association is working but we haven't told it to order by email yet. If you read it carefully it's telling us it expected andrew, mark, zoe but got andrew, zoe, mark.

The Diff is the difference between the two arrays.

Let's add ordering by email and get this test passing

~~~ruby
class Game < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :at, :location
  
  validates :location, :presence => true
  validates :at, :presence => true
  has_and_belongs_to_many :players, :class_name_ => 'User', :order => 'users.email ASC'
end
~~~

run the tests and you should now have just 5 tests failing

~~~console
bundle exec rake spec
~~~

COMMENTS

## Get the Game model test for ordering external_players by email passing
This is a very similar problem to the previous one so we won't spend too much time on this.

Create the association in Game. Note that our external\_players association is the same name as our class so we don't specify the :class_name

~~~ruby
class Game < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :at, :location
  
  validates :location, :presence => true
  validates :at, :presence => true
  
  has_and_belongs_to_many :players, :class_name => 'User', :order => "users.email ASC"
  has_and_belongs_to_many :external_players, :order => "external_players.email ASC"
end
~~~

Create the association in ExternalPlayer. Note that we don't need external\_player.games to be in any particular order.

~~~ruby
class ExternalPlayer < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :email
  
  has_and_belongs_to_many :games
end
~~~

Create the migration for the join table

~~~console
bundle exec rails g migration CreateExternalPlayersGamesJoinTable
~~~

Add this code to the migration

~~~ruby
class CreateExternalPlayersGamesJoinTable < ActiveRecord::Migration
 
  def change
    create_table :external_players_games, :id => false do |t|
      t.integer :external_player_id
      t.integer :game_id
    end
    
    add_index :external_players_games, :external_player_id
  	add_index :external_players_games, :game_id
  end
 
end
~~~

run the migration

~~~console
bundle exec rake db:migrate
~~~

now run the tests and we should be down to 4 tests passing

~~~console
bundle exec rake spec
~~~

COMMENTS

## Get Game model tests for the over? helper method passing
We want to have a simple helper method `.over?` that tells us whether the game is in the past or not. methods ending in `?` such as `valid?`, `over?`, `nil?` & `blank?` are a common ruby idiom where the method returns true or false.

This are the two tests we want to pass

~~~ruby
it 'should return true if the game is in the past' do
  game = Game.new(:at => Date.today - 1)
  game = game.over?.should be_true
end

it 'should return false if the game is not in the past' do
  game = Game.new(:at => Date.today + 1)
  game = game.over?.should be_false
end
~~~

Add the `.over?` method to our game model

~~~ruby
class Game < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :at, :location
  
  validates :location, :presence => true

## Get the ExternalPlayer model test for email passing
This is very similar to the test for name in our sports model. We'll use an ActiveModel validation to make sure that the email is present

We want this test to pass

~~~ruby
it 'should not be valid if the player has no email' do
  external_player = ExternalPlayer.new(:email => nil)
  external_player.valid?.should be_false
  external_player.errors.to_a.should include("Email can't be blank")
end
~~~ 

add this validation

~~~ruby
class ExternalPlayer < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :email
  
  validates :email, :presence => true
  
  has_and_belongs_to_many :games
end
~~~

run the tests and we should be down to 1 failing test

~~~console
bundle exec rake spec

## It should not be valid if the game has no owner
I don't believe in systems being to controlling so we want to be able to create a game that has no players so that the creator can:

1. Create a game then invite people later.
2. Organize a game but not have to be a player. 

A game with no players will just be orphaned in our system so we need to make a reference between the game and the user that created it.

~~~ruby
it 'should not be valid if the game has no owner' do
  game = Game.new
  game.valid?.should be_false
  game.errors.to_a.should include("Owner can't be blank")
end
~~~

We need to add a one to many association between user and games. Our user already has an association called 'games' so we'll create a more explicit association `user.owned_games` and add the reverse association `game.owner`.

First we'll need a migration:

~~~console
bundle exec rails g migration add_owner_to_game

invoke  active_record
     create    db/migrate/20120921122225_add_owner_to_game.rb
~~~

now every game will belong to user as owner so we'll add an owner\_id to the game model. In our newly generated migration file:

~~~ruby
class AddOwnerToGame < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    add\_column :games, :owner\_id, :integer
  end
end
~~~ 

run the migration:

~~~console
bundle exec rake db:migrate

==  AddOwnerToGame: migrating =================================================
-- add_column(:games, :owner\_id, :integer)
   -> 0.0015s
==  AddOwnerToGame: migrated (0.0016s) ========================================
~~~

Add the one to many association `belongs_to :owner, :class_name => 'User'` to our Game model. We'll also add :owner to our attr\_accessible so that we can create a game `Game.create(:sport => s)`

~~~ruby
class Game < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :at, :location, :sport, :owner
  
  validates :location, :presence => true
  validates :at, :presence => true
  validates :sport, :presence => true
  
  has_and_belongs_to_many :players, :class_name => 'User', :order => "users.email ASC"
  has_and_belongs_to_many :external_players, :order => "external_players.email ASC"
  belongs_to :sport
  belongs_to :owner, :class_name => 'User'
   
  def over?
    Time.now > self.at
  end
  
end
~~~

now add the association to user `has_many :owned_games, :class_name => 'Game'`:

~~~ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  # Include default devise modules. Others available are:
  # :token_authenticatable, :confirmable,
  # :lockable, :timeoutable and :omniauthable
  devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable,
         :recoverable, :rememberable, :trackable, :validatable

  # Setup accessible (or protected) attributes for your model
  attr_accessible :email, :password, :password_confirmation, :remember_me
  # attr_accessible :title, :body
  
  has_and_belongs_to_many :sports
  has_and_belongs_to_many :games
  
  has_many :players, :through => :games
  has_many :external_players, :through => :games
  
  has_many :owned_games, :class_name => 'Game', :foreign_key => :owner_id
end
~~~

run the tests and we will still have a failing spec:

~~~console
bundle exec rake spec

2) Game should not be valid if the game has no owner
    Failure/Error: game.errors.to_a.should include("Owner can't be blank")
      expected ["Location can't be blank", "At can't be blank", "Sport can't be blank"] to include "Owner can't be blank"
~~~

So let's add the validation `validates :owner, :presence => true` to the game model to make sure that we require an owner:

~~~ruby
class Game < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :at, :location
  
  validates :location, :presence => true
  validates :at, :presence => true
  validates :sport, :presence => true
  validates :owner, :presence => true
  
  has_and_belongs_to_many :players, :class_name => 'User', :order => "users.email ASC"
  has_and_belongs_to_many :external_players, :order => "external_players.email ASC"
  belongs_to :sport
  belongs_to :owner, :class_name => 'User'
   
  def over?
    Time.now > self.at
  end
  
end
~~~

~~~console
bundle exec rake spec

1) Game should return a list of players ordered by email
     Failure/Error: game = FactoryGirl.create(:game, :sport => sport)
     ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid:
       Validation failed: Owner can't be blank
     # ./spec/models/game_spec.rb:25:in `block (2 levels) in <top (required)>'

  2) Game should return a list of external players ordered by email
     Failure/Error: game = FactoryGirl.create(:game, :sport => sport)
     ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid:
       Validation failed: Owner can't be blank
     # ./spec/models/game_spec.rb:40:in `block (2 levels) in <top (required)>'
~~~

Our test will pass but now we require an owner we've broken two existing tests !!! Luckily all we need do is add an owner to our game factory in `spec/factories/games.rb`

~~~console
FactoryGirl.define do
  factory :game do
    location "MyString"
    at "2012-09-09 10:00:00"
    sport { FactoryGirl.create(:sport) }   
    owner { FactoryGirl.create(:user) }    
  end
end
~~~ 

## Get the ExternalPlayer email must be unique test passing
This is very similar to the test for uniqueness of name in our sports model. We'll use an ActiveModel validation to make sure that the email doesn't already exist.

This is the test we want to pass. Note that we create a an ExternalPlayer in the first line then attempt to create another

~~~ruby
it 'should not be valid if the email already exists' do
  ExternalPlayer.create(:email => 'bolt@lighting.co.uk')

  external_player = ExternalPlayer.new(:email => 'bolt@lighting.co.uk')
  external_player.valid?.should be_false
  external_player.errors.to_a.should include("Email already taken")
end
~~~

Add the email uniqueness validation to ExternalPlayer

~~~ruby
class ExternalPlayer < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :email
  
  validates :email, :presence => true, :uniqueness => true
  
  has_and_belongs_to_many :games
end
~~~

run the tests and everything should be passing

~~~console
bundle exec rake spec
~~~


## Active Record Associations
Now we have a little experience with Active Record associations let's take a peek under the hood by playing with them in console. Run these in the Rails console looking at the SQL output as we go:

1. Reference the first User
2. Create a game for that user using the association 
3. Call user.games.size to see how many games the user has
4. Call user.games.count to see how many games the user has

~~~console
rails c

Loading development environment (Rails 3.2.8)

   (0.2ms)  INSERT INTO "games_users" ("user_id", "game_id") VALUES (1, 2)
   (2.8ms)  commit transaction

  Game Load (0.3ms)  SELECT "games".* FROM "games" INNER JOIN "games_users" ON "games"."id" = "games_users"."game_id" WHERE "games_users"."user_id" = 1	

irb(main):003:0> user.games.count
   (0.2ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "games" INNER JOIN "games_users" ON "games"."id" = "games_users"."game_id" WHERE "games_users"."user_id" = 1	

~~~

Note: Where I've written `user.games.create(:at => Date.today, :location => "wimbledon")` I could just as easily have written `Game.create(:at => Date.today, :location => "wimbledon", :user => user)` but I think the first way is more expressive.

Perhaps most important thing to take from this is the last two lines, `user.games.size` and `user.games.count`. They look like the same thing but in fact produce quite different SQL statements. The first produces a select games.* and the second select count(*). Unless you specify otherwise, ActiveRecord associations are lazy loaded. That means when we loaded our user with `User.first` ActiveRecord didn't load the associated games. This makes a lot of sense; imagine what would happen if our user had thousands of games but all you wanted was to load the user to get his or her name. Loading thousands of associated games that are never going to be used by our code at the time would add a lot of additional load on our system. Associations are left empty until you do reference them `user.games` or call `.each`, `.size`,`.to_a` (to an array). ActiveRecord won't load objects when you carry out operations like `.count` or `.sum` on them.

Let's try this again. Take a look at the out put below from my console.

1. `User.first` does a select users
1. `user.games.count` does a count on the games_user many-to-many join
1. `user.games` does a select games and returns a collection of games
1. `user.games` a second time doesn't do any sql and just returns the loaded games collection.
1. If our application is very dynamic and something may have added a game to the database while we were loking at our user then `user.games.reload` issues a new sql query and the games collection is refreshed.
